#TASK1 - PART1 -SPEECH TO TEXT 

-->I created a simple application that converts speech to text in Arabic that contains 4 buttons, the first buttons record audio and convert it to text, then the second button pauses the audio recording for a temporary period, and the last button saves the voice note that has been converted to text.

-->Also save the note either by speaking and converting to text or by writing directly and then saving it.

--> Also, when saving the note, I set the option to listen to the written note that was saved in Arabic audio .
