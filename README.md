#TASK1 - PART1 -SPEECH TO TEXT 

--> I created a simple application that converts speech to text in Arabic and also memorize the note either by speaking and converting to text or by writing directly and then save it.

--> Also, when saving the note, I set the option to listen to the written note that was saved in Arabic audio .
